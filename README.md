# Empty Droplets detection in SUMseq
This repo is an annual project made during studies in Bioinformatics Institute by Shakir Suleimanov, Maria Lukina and Vladimir Grigoriants

## Introduction to SUMseq technology

SUM-seq (Single-cell Ultra-high-throughput Multiomic sequencing) is introduced as a cost-effective and scalable sequencing technique designed for multiplexed multiomics profiling. This method enables the simultaneous profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single nuclei at an ultra-high-throughput scale, accommodating up to millions of cells and hundreds of samples. The technique refines the two-step combinatorial indexing approach, initially introduced by Datlinger et al. for snRNA-seq, adapting it specifically for a multiomic context.

In the SUM-seq process, accessible chromatin and nuclear RNA are first tagged with a sample-specific index through transposition and reverse transcription, respectively. Following this, a second index is added using a droplet-based microfluidic platform, such as 10X Chromium. This dual indexing approach allows the overloading of microfluidic droplets while maintaining the ability to assign matched RNA- and ATAC-seq reads to the same individual cell.
